There are three executable files:

-- favarpcbootni.m
Computes FAVAR impulse response functions for the benchmark model (Fig 1 and 3)
Computes variance decompositions reported in Table 1 (See irfbootfac2step.m)

-- favarvarcomp.m
Performs the FAVAR -- VAR comparison (top panel of Fig5).
Results are save in .mat files

-- plotfavarvar.m
Plots IRF's for the FAVAR-VAR comparison
Uses output of the previous two programs as input
